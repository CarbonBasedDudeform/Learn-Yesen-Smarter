This is a tool for automating the task of reviewing learned information using spaced-repetition.

Spaced repetition is a learning technique aimed at improving the memorisation of content by efficiently reviewing it at increasing intervals.
Eg. You learn the word cat in spanish is el gato. A week later you review this content (cat = el gato), then a month later, then 6 months later.
This graph demonstrates how the practice is supposed to work.

The aim of this software is to apply this process to tasks other than flashcards. So for example,
First off you start by learning a new algorithm
You create a pros and cons task for this algorithm highlighting the benefits (efficient, correctness) and the negatives (requires sorted input data, difficult to understand)
Then you review this content at increasing intervals until it's in your long term memory.
As a result, you can recall the pros and cons of the algorithm without having to look them up.

Another example would be learning the process of first aid.
Usually, first aid training requires taking refresher courses to remind you of the proper process.
This tool could be used to aid this as you could create a task where you need to list the 5 things you should do and shouldn't do
then review theses things at increasing intervals until they are in your long term memory. 

Lastly, one of the main benefits of this tool over others is that it only matches keywords in the answers.
Alternatives are usually aimed at language learning and based around the concept of flashcards.
This means that setting the answer as "the cat sat on the mat" will require the user to memorise that sentence word for word.
If you are mainly intereseted in memorising the pros and cons, or the dos and don'ts of a subject, then you'll not be bothered that your 
answer doesn't 100% match your original. ie. "cat sat on mat" is the same as "the cat sat on the mat", you'd want that to be marked correct 
as you're mainly interested in learning the concepts, the key ideas, rather than the exact syntax and grammar of the original answer.
